# Expense Tracker

A simple and elegant web-based Expense Tracker that allows users to add, view, and delete daily expenses. It also calculates the total expense in real-time and persists the data using localStorage.

## Features

- Add expenses with name and amount
- View a list of added expenses
- Delete individual expenses
- Automatically updates total expense
- Data is saved in localStorage and persists across sessions
- Clean, responsive dark-themed user interface

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for dynamic behavior and logic
- **localStorage** to persist data in the browser

## How It Works

1. The user fills out the expense name and amount in the form.
2. Upon submission, the expense is added to the list and saved in localStorage.
3. Each expense is rendered in the list with a delete button.
4. Total amount is recalculated and updated automatically.
5. Expenses remain stored even after refreshing or closing the browser.
